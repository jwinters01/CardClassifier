*** Next Couple of Days ***
Edge detector
use pca's to compare hand shot images to scanned images

fast search algorithm to look through all the PCA compressed images

Steps:
1. extract images with line detectors
2. Apply PCA to extracted images
3. Apply Kmeans/heirarchial clustering to extracted images
4. Binary search to find image

heirarchial clustering library python
